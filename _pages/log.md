    * attended meeting
* **Tuesday**: 
    * Created a pull request to add my link to the bootcamp website
    * Ran into a bug in pytest
        * Found out that I was calling pytest from Python2 although I have pytest-3 installed. I resolved it by explicitly calling pytest-3 
    * Fixed the python 3.5 ordered dictionary issue, SpyDrNet should be able to pass Travis CI python 3.5 test
        * I replaced all the standard dict() in the parser.py file with OrderedDict and it worked
